## 🔬 Part 2: Practical Implementation

### 🔹 Task 1 – Classical ML with Scikit-learn
- **Dataset:** Iris Species
- **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall
- **Script:** `task1_scikit_iris.ipynb`

### 🔹 Task 2 – Deep Learning with TensorFlow
- **Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digits
- **Model:** CNN
- **Goal:** >95% test accuracy
- **Script:** `task2_tensorflow_mnist.ipynb`

### 🔹 Task 3 – NLP with spaCy
- **Dataset:** Amazon Product Reviews
- **Tasks:** NER + Sentiment Analysis
- **Script:** `task3_spacy_nlp.ipynb`

## 🛡️ Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

- Bias reflection on datasets (MNIST, Amazon reviews)
- Fairness tools mentioned (e.g., TensorFlow Fairness Indicators, spaCy rules)
- Troubleshooting common TensorFlow bugs
